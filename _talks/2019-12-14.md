Pattern recognition problems in high energy physics are notably different from
traditional machine learning applications in computer vision. Reconstruction algo-
rithms identify and measure the kinematic properties of particles produced in high
energy collisions and recorded with complex detector systems. Two critical appli-
cations are the reconstruction of charged particle trajectories in tracking detectors
and the reconstruction of particle showers in calorimeters. These two problems
have unique challenges and characteristics, but both have high dimensionality,
high degree of sparsity, and complex geometric layouts. Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) are a relatively new class of deep learning architectures which can deal
with such data effectively, allowing scientists to incorporate domain knowledge
in a graph structure and learn powerful representations leveraging that structure
to identify patterns of interest. In this work we demonstrate the applicability of
GNNs to these two diverse particle reconstruction problems.
