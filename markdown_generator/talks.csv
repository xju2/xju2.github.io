In this seminar, I restricted myself on the four-lepton analysis itself and gave a decent level of details of this analysis."
Search for heavy ZZ resonances in the four-lepton and ll&#957;&#957; final states with the ATLAS detector,Talk@US ATLAS workshop,t,Argonne National Laboratory,2017-07-25,"Lemont, IL, US",https://indico.cern.ch/event/631514/contributions/2659552/attachments/1498399/2332658/20170725_xju_highmass_4l_llvv.pdf,"I presented the search for heavy ZZ resonances in ATLAS with 13 TeV data. Two excesses were found with four-lepton invariant mass at around 240 GeV and 700 GeV, each with a local significance of 3.4 standard deviations and a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations. More data are needed to confirm or reject the two excesses."
