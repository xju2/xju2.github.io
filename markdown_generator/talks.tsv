Selected key perspectives of H &rarr; ZZ analysis in LHC Run 2	Talk@Higgs workshop	t	Sapienza Universita di Roma	2014-04-18	Rome, Italy	https://indico.cern.ch/event/289241/contributions/1643578/attachments/540089/744431/HiggsWorkshop_Rome_20140418_v2.pdf	LHC was expected to start its second run of proton-proton collisions at an unprecedented center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in proton-proton collision data. I were representing the four-lepton analysis team to present the highlighted perspectives our analysis want to focus in the coming LHC Run 2.

Recent results of the Higgs measurements and searches in ATLAS	Seminar@Nanjing University	s	Nanjing University	2016-12-21	Nanjing, China		I presented the recent results on the Higgs physics sector, including the measurement of its properties and the search for Higgs boson-like particles in high mass region.
Higgs measurements and search for new physics in four-lepton channel	Seminar@Shandong University	s	Shandong University	2016-12-23	Shandong, China		This seminar is very similar to the one I gave in Nanjing University. In this seminar, I restricted myself on the four-lepton analysis itself and gave a decent level of details of this analysis.
Search for heavy ZZ resonances in the four-lepton and ll&#957;&#957; final states with the ATLAS detector	Talk@US ATLAS workshop	t	Argonne National Laboratory	2017-07-25	Lemont, IL, US	https://indico.cern.ch/event/631514/contributions/2659552/attachments/1498399/2332658/20170725_xju_highmass_4l_llvv.pdf	I presented the search for heavy ZZ resonances in ATLAS with 13 TeV data. Two excesses were found with four-lepton invariant mass at around 240 GeV and 700 GeV, each with a local significance of 3.4 standard deviations and a global significance of 2.2 standard deviations. More data are needed to confirm or reject the two excesses.
