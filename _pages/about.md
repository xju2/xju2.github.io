I am a computing system engineer in the scientific data division at the Berkeley Lab, focusing on particle physics and machine learning. I am also a member of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. 

In particle physics, my research interest is to understand the electroweak interactions; in machine learning, I am interested in developing softwares and machine learning models to enable precision physics measurements and the search for new physics. 

I have been enjoying working with undergraduate and graduate students coming from global institutes. I am also an associated editor in Big Data and AI in HEP in Frontiers.
