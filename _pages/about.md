I am a Computing System Engineer at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
My research interests are to use advanced computing and Machine Learning to solve computing problems in particle physics
and to understand the electroweak interactions through the Large Hadron Collider.

<!--Below shows some beautiful results to which I have make significant contributions.
