This page lists the projects I am working on or interested in. Still under construction!

## High-Performance Software and Algorithms
* **Language models for particle detectors.** Language models have revolutionized natural language understanding and communication. Particle detectors are complex apparatuses whose language is made of raw data organized in subdetectors and readout modules. The project aims to train a language model that understands a detectorâ€™s vocabulary and can translate its raw data to higher-level constructs like clusters, tracks, jets, etc.

* **IPUs for Particle Tracking**. GraphCore IPUs are designed to massively parallel multiple instructions, multiple data, and fine-grained, high-performance computing. The project aims to port existing tracking algorithms (traditional and/or ML-based) to IPUs and compare the computing performance with CPUs and GPUs.
