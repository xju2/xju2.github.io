This page lists the projects I am working on or interested in.

## Machine Learning for Particle Physics
* **Language models for particle detectors.** Language models have revolutionized natural language understanding. Particle detectors are complex apparatuses whose language is made of data organized in sub-detectors and readout modules. The project aims to train a language model that understands a detectorâ€™s vocabulary and can translate its raw data to higher-level constructs like clusters, tracks, jets, etc.

* **Pattern recognition in a point cloud of measurements** Scientific data are often represented as 3D points, each associated with measurements (like a point cloud). Pattern recognition in a point cloud of measurements is challenging due to its combinatorial complexity. The project aims to leverage deep learning models to solve the issue.

* **Deep generative models for simulation**. Particle simulations are often computationally expensive. The project aims to use deep generative models to simulate particle interactions with high fidelity and low computational cost.

* **Anomaly detection in a point cloud of measurements**. Representing learning is proven to be a powerful self-supervised learning technique. However, how to leverage the learned representation for anomaly detection in a point cloud of measurements is still an open question.
