This page lists the projects I am working on or interested in.

## Machine Learning for Particle Physics
* **Language models for particle detectors.** Language models have revolutionized natural language understanding and communication. Particle detectors are complex apparatuses whose language is made of raw data organized in subdetectors and readout modules. The project aims to train a language model that understands a detectorâ€™s vocabulary and can translate its raw data to higher-level constructs like clusters, tracks, jets, etc.

* **Pattern recognition in point clouds** Scientific data are often represented as a set of measurements (like point clouds). Pattern recognition in point cloud measurements is a challenging task due to its combinatorial complexity. The project aims to leverage deep learning models to solve the issue.

* **Deep generative models for simulation**. Particle simulations are often computationally expensive. The project aims to develop deep generative models that can simulate particle interactions with high fidelity and low computational cost.

* **Anomaly detection in point clouds**. Representing learning is proven to be a powerful self-supervised learning technique. However, how to leverage the learned representation for anomaly detection in point clouds is still an open question.
